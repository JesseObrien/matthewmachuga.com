  series: Building Multitenant Apps in Laravel
  description: >
    In fall of 2014, in response to dozens of questions from the Laravel IRC
    channel regarding multitenant apps, I proposed this course to Tuts+.  The
    course acts as a primer for someone converting (or starting) an application
    into a multitenant architecture while keeping business concerns in mind.
    The course covers both single-database and multiple-database styles of
    multitenancy, and demonstrates the intricacies of each with Laravel.
  topics:
    - PHP
    - Laravel
    - Multitenancy
    - Design Patterns

    In winter of 2013-2014 I created Tuts+ Premium course targeted at teaching
    PHP developers some basic and advanced OOD concepts. The goal was to
    introduce the basic premise of OOD, demonstrate some examples of how to
    potentially improve code quality and testability, and also introduce some
    patterns and concepts to sharpen their skills. There were 16 episodes total
    and the source files are provided with the course.
  topics:
    - PHP
    - OOD
    - Design Patterns
    - Hexagonal Architecture

    In late winter 2012-2013, I created a course for Envato's Tuts+ Premium
    where I built the same application in Rails and Laravel. The goal was to
    demonstrate how the same application could be built with either framework
    or language, along with present a survey of each platform. There are 15
    lessons, and over an hour spent on each platform in total.  All source files
    are provided in two git respositories with a Tuts+ Premium subscription.
  topics:
    - Laravel 3.2
    - Rails 3.2
    - Environments
    - TDD
    - Authentication
    - Authorization
    - CRUD

- title: Laravel 3.2 Application Walkthrough
  type: single

    I had to make an application to generate escort cards for my fianc√©e.
    About half way through, a user on freenode #laravel expressed interest in
    seeing what I was creating. I thought that overall this might make a good
    screencast as it is extremely simplistic and touches on a few neat areas
    of Laravel, and shows how fast you can get up and running. My screencast
    software wasn't too great so it clipped some audio at the beginning and
    makes reds appear awkwardly.
  topics:
    - Vim
    - iTerm2
    - MySQL
    - Apache 2
    - PHP 5.4
    - Laravel 3.2
    - Firefox 12
